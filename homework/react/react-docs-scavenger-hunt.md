# React Documentation Scavenger Hunt

[React Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html)

### Post answers (and links to where you found them) for each of the questions below:

1. Can we use `npm` with React or do we have to use `yarn`?

You can actually use either one.

2. We are using JSX to write HTML inside of our React. Are we required to use JSX with React? Are there any alternatives?

You are not required to use JSX. Basically if you don't use JSX then you are forced to use plain JavaScript.

3. Does React re-render the entire component when one part of it changes?

No only the element that changes within the component gets updated or re renders.

4. Should we ever change `props` (or parameters) inside of a component? 

No.

5. Are all components classes? 

They are functions but can be declared using the ES6 class.


6. List five "Synthetic Events" provided by React:

Mouse events 
Form Events
Selection Events
Touch Evenets
Media Events

7. Do we have to use ES6 syntax with React?

No, you can use React tools instead. for example instead of a ES6 class declaration you can use create-react-class

8. Where can I go to check out React's built-in Accessibility features?

The Accessibility tab in the React docs.  There are lots of built in functions and tools.

9. List five React Component Lifecycle Methods:

compoentDidMount()
setState()
componentWillUnmount()
render()
constructor()


10. Where would I go to check out React's built-in testing tools?

This is also under the accessiblity tab. There are lots of built in testing in the browser and many tutorials on how to use them.
